# Java-SQL-Database-Application
Utilizes MySQL + Java connector to create a proof of concept prototype application.

This project was created as a proof of concept for a personal recipe application. 
The idea is that a user will enter their desired grocer and their preferences including 
parameters like level of difficulty, cooking time, spice level, and more. Based on the
preferences, the application will recommend certain recipes. Each recipe will include
all the ingredients required as well as the cost of purchasing enough of the ingredients
from the chosen grocer. Altering the user preferences such as level of difficulty will
immediately update the list of recommended recipes based on the changes. 

### Features
Features of the application include
- individualized user preferences
- recipe recommendations based on preferences
- recipe comments
- sharing recipes with other user via messages

# Disclaimer
As a proof of concept application, it does not include real-world data with regard to
grocer ingredient prices. The database was populated with example data for testing because
access to a real grocer's API and database/price information was not available.
